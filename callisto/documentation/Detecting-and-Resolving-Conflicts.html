      As you might have noticed already,
Callisto may show a message like
      <code>
       2 conflict(s) logged to C:/my_hack/conflicts.txt
      </code>
      at the end
of a
      <code>
       Rebuild
      </code>
      . This is Callisto’s conflict detection feature
in action!
     </p>
     <p>
      What this feature allows you to do is see at a glance which locations
in your ROM are getting written to multiple times by different tools or
resources. Since any particular byte in your ROM can only hold a single
value between 0-255, if multiple things try to write to the same byte,
only the last one in the build order will actually have any effect! This
can lead to unexpected problems, a certain patch might write to an
address and understandably expect the bytes it wrote there to stay like
that. If another patch then comes along later and overwrites the earlier
patch’s changes, the first patch might break! Issues like this are
surprisingly common and have historically been very annoying to figure
out and fix, since there are so many moving parts involved in hacking.
This is what Callisto aims to fix.
     </p>
     <p>
      With conflict detection enabled, Callisto will do the following
during
      <code>
       Rebuild
      </code>
      :
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       after every step of the
       <code>
        build_order
       </code>
       , create a snapshot
of the temporary ROM
      </li>
      <li>
       note any addresses that were changed by the current build step
      </li>
      <li>
       at the end of the build process, note any addresses that were
written to by multiple build steps
      </li>
      <li>
       report the addresses that were written to multiple times and which
build steps wrote to them
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      It’s a fairly simple process, but it is highly effective!
     </p>
     <h1 id="configuration">
      Configuration
     </h1>
     <p>
      Let’s take a brief look at the settings that affect conflict
detection. By default, these are all located in the
      <code>
       project.toml
      </code>
      file, so go ahead and open that now if you
want to follow along.
     </p>

     <p>
      The
      <code>
       check_conflicts
      </code>
      setting determines if Callisto
should check for conflicts at all and if so, where it should do so.
     </p>
     <p>
      Here are the meanings of the three valid values:
     </p>

       <tr class="even">
        <td>
         hijacks
        </td>
        <td>
         Only check for conflicts in the vanilla area of the ROM (from PC

       </tr>
       <tr class="odd">
        <td>
         all

       </tr>
      </tbody>
     </table>
     <p>
      Conflict detection is performed in a separate thread from the main
build process, so the performance hit of enabling it should be minimal,
which is why I would generally recommend using the
      <code>
       hijacks
      </code>
      setting. Note that while
      <code>
       all
      </code>
      may sound useful, it is prone
to spotting a lot of false positives (meaning two or more writes to the
same address happen, but there is no actual problem), which makes it
overly verbose in most situations.
      <code>
       hijacks
      </code>
      generally spots
actually important conflicts and redundancies.

      This setting specifies the path where Callisto will output a file

like, leaving it in the root of your project may be undesirable for
some.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you remove this setting, Callisto will output the conflicts
directly during the build process, which I would not recommend, as it
gets hard to look at quickly if there are many conflicts.

      This setting specifies which symbols should not factor into conflict
detection. You can put anything that appears in the build order, as well
as explicit patch/module paths in here if you want. This basically means
that if, for example, the
      <code>
       ExGraphics
      </code>
      step and the
      <code>
       AddMusicK
      </code>
      step of the
      <code>
       build_order
      </code>
      both wrote
to the same bytes, this would
      <strong>
       not
      </strong>
      be noted as a
conflict by Callisto. But if
      <code>
       ExGraphics
      </code>
      ,
      <code>
       AddMusicK
      </code>
      <strong>
       and
      </strong>
      <code>
       UberASM
      </code>
      all
wrote to the same byte, this
      <strong>
       would
      </strong>
      be noted by
Callisto, as there are at least
      <strong>
       two
      </strong>
      non-ignored steps
writing to the same address. The write by
      <code>
       ExGraphics
      </code>
      would
also be included in the conflict report in this case for completeness,
even if it didn’t itself trigger the conflict detection.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are quite a lot of ignored symbols in this list by default.
This is due to these seemingly triggering a lot of false positives and
generally uninteresting conflicts which clutter the conflict report and
make it less useful for detecting actually important conflicts (like
patch &lt;-&gt; patch conflicts, tool &lt;-&gt; tool conflicts or patch
&lt;-&gt; tool conflicts).
     </p>
     <h1 id="lets-detect-some-conflicts">
      Let’s Detect some Conflicts
     </h1>
     <p>
      That’s it for configuration! Let’s now look at a practical example
for detecting conflicts.
     </p>
     <p>
      First, we want a baseline, when I build my empty project which uses
PIXI, GPS, AddMusicK, UberASMTool and no patches, Callisto logs two
conflicts during rebuilds. These are likely false positives and I will
ignore them for now (I will give tips for reducing false positives later
on).
     </p>
     <p>
      Now, I will add two patches to my project:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <a href="https://smwc.me/s/18862">
        Remove Status Bar
       </a>
      </li>
      <li>
       <a href="https://smwc.me/s/21364">
        Mario + Animated Tile ExGFX
v2.1
       </a>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      In my case, my
      <code>
       patches
      </code>
      list will then look like
this:
     </p>
     <div class="sourceCode" id="cb4">
      <pre class="sourceCode toml"><code class="sourceCode toml"><span id="cb4-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb4-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">[resources]</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb4-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">patches</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="op">[</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb4-3" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="st">"resources/patches/nuke_statusbar.asm"</span><span class="op">,</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb4-4" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="st">"resources/patches/marioexgfx.asm"</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb4-5" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">]</span></span></code></pre>
     </div>
     <p>
      After I
      <code>
       Rebuild
      </code>
      , Callisto now tells me
      <code>
       4 conflict(s) logged to C:/my_hack/conflicts.txt
      </code>
      ,
interesting!
     </p>
     <p>
      Checking the
      <code>
       conflicts.txt
      </code>
      file, I can see two new and
one changed conflict:
     </p>
     <pre><code>Conflict - 0x5 bytes at SNES: $008E1A (unheadered), PC: 0x00101A (headered):
    Original bytes:
        AD 93 14 05 9D 
    Patch (resources\patches\nuke_statusbar.asm):
        00 00 00 00 00 
    UberASM:
        5C 4F F5 90 EA 

Conflict - 0x3 bytes at SNES: $00A5D5 (unheadered), PC: 0x0027D5 (headered):
    Original bytes:

    Patch (resources\patches\nuke_statusbar.asm):
        80 01 EA 
    Patch (resources\patches\marioexgfx.asm):
        22 D0 81 

Conflict - 0x3 bytes at SNES: $05D8B9 (unheadered), PC: 0x02DAB9 (headered):
    Original bytes:
        A5 0E 0A 
    Patch (resources\patches\marioexgfx.asm):
        EA EA EA 
    PIXI:
        20 46 DC 
    UberASM:
        EA EA EA </code></pre>
     <p>
      (Depending on your setup, you may see different conflicts.)
     </p>
     <p>
      Let’s look at just the last of these conflicts to get a feel for the
format:
     </p>
     <pre><code>Conflict - 0x3 bytes at SNES: $05D8B9 (unheadered), PC: 0x02DAB9 (headered):
    Original bytes:
        A5 0E 0A 
    Patch (resources\patches\marioexgfx.asm):
        EA EA EA 
    PIXI:
        20 46 DC 
    UberASM:
        EA EA EA </code></pre>
     <p>
      Let’s start with the first line:
     </p>
     <pre><code>Conflict - 0x3 bytes at SNES: $05D8B9 (unheadered), PC: 0x02DAB9 (headered):</code></pre>
     <p>
      This tells us that there are 3 bytes which were written to multiple
times. These bytes are located at the unheadered SNES address $05D8B9
(note that these addresses can be written multiple ways due to
      <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Super_NES_Programming/SNES_memory_map#LoROM">
       LoROM
addressing
      </a>
      ). Callisto also shows the headered PC address which may
be helpful for finding the bytes in some hex editors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Next comes the list of writes:
     </p>
     <pre><code>    Original bytes:
        A5 0E 0A 
    Patch (resources\patches\marioexgfx.asm):
        EA EA EA 
    PIXI:
        20 46 DC 
    UberASM:
        EA EA EA </code></pre>
     <p>
      These are ordered top to bottom with the first write at the top and
the last write at the bottom. The three bytes under
      <code>
       Original bytes
      </code>
      show the bytes that were at that location in
the vanilla SMW ROM, every subsequent entry shows the three bytes that
the corresponding resource wrote to the same location.
     </p>
     <p>
      Out of the four conflicts Callisto logged during our last
      <code>
       Rebuild
      </code>
      , the most notable of them is the third one between
      <code>
       nuke_statusbar.asm
      </code>
      and
      <code>
       marioexgfx.asm
      </code>
      . This is
an actual real incompatibility between the two patches we just found!
The other conflicts between the patches and
      <code>
       UberASM
      </code>
      and
      <code>
       PIXI
      </code>
      might also be interesting to look at if it turns out
our hack is having issues after we applied the patches. It is important
to note that just because Callisto logs something as a conflict, doesn’t
necessarily mean that it is an actual problem. Patches and tools
      <strong>
       can
      </strong>
      write to the same location and either intentionally
or accidentally not cause any problems. Conflicts logged by Callisto
only serve as a helpful starting point for further investigation, since
Callisto cannot possibly know if the authors of two different resources
are aware of each other’s modifications and have accounted for them!
     </p>
     <p>
      In this case, if we run into actual problems in our hack after we
have applied the two patches, we might consult
      <code>
       conflicts.txt
      </code>
      , see that the patches have a conflict and
then try to comment out one or both of the patches in the
      <code>
       patches
      </code>
      list, to see if the issue still occurs. If it does
not, we have located an actual conflict, otherwise, we may need to look
elsewhere for the problem.
     </p>
     <p>
      After you have confirmed that there is an actual conflict, further
steps may be:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       reporting the conflict to the author(s) of the conflicting
resource(s)
      </li>
      <li>
       working around the issue by using alternative resources
      </li>
      <li>
       attempting to fix the incompatibility yourself (if you know
ASM)
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      That’s pretty much it! Again, I want to stress that conflicts
reported by Callisto are
      <strong>
       not
      </strong>
      guaranteed to actually be
problematic, but do often warrant further investigation, as even if
there is no immediate problem, it is often inherently suspicious for
multiple resources to write to the same memory location as there is a
good chance this is not intentional.
     </p>
     <p>
      That’s pretty much all there is to conflict detection. As we saw,
while Callisto makes it simple enough to find potential conflicts,
verifying that they are actually an issue and fixing them can still take
considerable effort.

      As we saw at the start, I originally had two conflicts before
applying the two patches. Here they are:
     </p>
     <pre><code>Conflict - 0x3 bytes at SNES: $008179 (unheadered), PC: 0x000379 (headered):
    Original bytes:
        AD FB 1D 
    AddMusicK:
        EA EA EA 
    UberASM:
        AD FB 1D 

Conflict - 0x3 bytes at SNES: $05D8B9 (unheadered), PC: 0x02DAB9 (headered):
    Original bytes:
        A5 0E 0A 
    PIXI:
        20 46 DC 
    UberASM:
        EA EA EA </code></pre>
     <p>
      As we can see, these are tool &lt;-&gt; tool conflicts, one between
AddMusicK and UberASM and one between PIXI and UberASM. As it turns out,
I can get rid of the first one by just switching the insertion order of
AddMusicK and UberASM in my
      <code>
       build_order
      </code>
      . This is because
while AddMusicK ensures it doesn’t overwrite what UberASM wrote at this
location, the opposite is not the case.
     </p>
     <p>
      This just leaves me with:
     </p>
     <pre><code>Conflict - 0x3 bytes at SNES: $05D8B9 (unheadered), PC: 0x02DAB9 (headered):
    Original bytes:

        20 46 DC 
    UberASM:
        EA EA EA </code></pre>
     <p>
      This stems from the following lines in
      <code>
       pixi/asm/main.asm
      </code>
      :
     </p>
     <pre><code>; make it so the full level number can be read from $010B

    Levelnum:
    LDA $0E

     <p>
      and the following lines in
      <code>
       uberasm_tool/asm/base/main.asm
      </code>
      :
     </p>
     <pre><code>ORG $05D8B7
    BRA +
    NOP #3        ;the levelnum patch goes here in many ROMs, just skip over it

    LDA.w $E601,Y
    STA $69        
    BRA +
ORG $05D8E0
    +</code></pre>
     <p>
      we can see that UberASMTool replaces PIXI’s
      <code>
       JSR Levelnum
      </code>
      with
      <code>
       NOP #3
      </code>
      , this matches what the conflict shows, since
      <code>
       EA EA EA
      </code>
      is
      <code>
       NOP #3
      </code>
      !
     </p>
     <p>
      As UberASMTool is actually aware of what PIXI is doing and restores
the same behavior, this is
      <strong>
       not
      </strong>
      a true conflict. To get
rid of this, an easy way is to just remove PIXI’s lines from the
      <code>
       pixi/asm/main.asm
      </code>
      file, though this does mean if I ever
remove UberASMTool from my project, I may have to add those lines back
later!
     </p>
     <p>
      Either way, after I remove those lines from PIXI’s file and rebuild,
I get
      <code>
       No conflicts logged to C:/my_hack/conflicts.txt
      </code>
      ,
great!
     </p>
     <p>
      While attempting to ensure that your project contains no conflicts
might seem like a good idea, it is probably not sustainable given that
there are plenty of intentional and non-problematic “conflicts” out
there. I would generally recommend taking note when the number of
conflicts in your project increases, but not necessarily to attempt to
keep the number as low as possible at all times.
