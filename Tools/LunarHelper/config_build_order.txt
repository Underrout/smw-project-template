-- Build Order

-- Specifies the order in which resources are inserted
-- into the ROM when you use the Build function, feel free to 
-- move items around or remove them if you're not using them

-- The same step can be specified multiple times if you require things
-- to be inserted two or more times at different points

-- You can also specify individual patches in this list by just 
-- writing out their path as it appears in the patches list above, 
-- this patch will then be inserted at that step instead of being
-- applied at the same time as the other Patches

-- This default build order is completely vanilla, to insert
-- any of the included tools, just uncomment the tool's entry
-- in the build order
